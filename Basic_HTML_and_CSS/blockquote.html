    <blockquote cite="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Sett">
    A leader of Ioniaâ€™s growing criminal underworld, Sett rose to prominence in the wake of the war with Noxus. 
    Though he began as a humble challenger in the fighting pits of Navori, he quickly gained notoriety for his 
    savage strength, and his ability to take seemingly endless amounts of punishment. After fighting his way through 
    the ranks of local combatants, Sett muscled to the top, seizing control of the pits he once fought in.
