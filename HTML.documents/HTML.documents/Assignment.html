	<blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/kai-ken/">
	The Kai Ken is a medium-sized dog and is one of the six native Japanese breeds or Nihon Ken. Traditionally used to hunt a wide range of game in the mountains of Japan, the Kai Ken is considered a <br>rare breed even in Japan. The Kai is highly intelligent and learns quickly. They seem to learn as fast as the other Japanese <br>breeds if not faster. They are not as independent and are more willing to please their companions. The Japanese describe the Kai Ken as a trustworthy guardian and extremely devoted to his master.
