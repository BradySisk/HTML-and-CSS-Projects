<h1>Cowboys</h1>
	<p>
Cowboys are a solid team and have been for while yet we are lucky to get to the playoffs.With all the talent they have had in the past decade the one thing that has remained the same is coach Garrett,i believe his time is up 
and with Jerry Jones publically throwing coahing under the bus after their lose to the patriots.(which we should of won) I think Jones may finally grow a pair and fire Garrett Im not even a cowboy fan but i would like 
to see someone else besides the lame ass patriots in the super bowl and i believe the cowboys are a team that could do it.

<h3>Solution<h3>
	<p>First part of the solution is of course fire Garrett just get him out of here! Second part would be hire Tony Romo as the head coach,listening to that man calling the plays before they even happen is absolutely
 banannas his football IQ is very high and not only that he would already have the respect of the players.Romo would be more of a risk taker istead of dealing with conserative Garrett which i think the team needs,they are
 having trouble running the ball with their 90 MILLION!! dollar running back and i believe thats mostly due to Garretts conserative playcalling.So i say screw it Hire Romo and lets see what happens........could'nt get any worse right???

	<h3>KAI KEN INFO</H3>
	<P>The Kai Ken is a medium-sized dog and is one of the six native Japanese breeds or Nihon Ken. Traditionally used to hunt a wide range of game in the mountains of Japan, the Kai Ken is considered a rare breed even in Japan. The 
	Kai is highly intelligent and learns quickly. They seem to learn as fast as the other Japanese breeds if not faster. They are not as independent and are more willing to please their companions. The Japanese describe the Kai Ken as 
	a trustworthy guardian and extremely devoted to his master.</P>
